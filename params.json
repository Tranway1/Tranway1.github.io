{"name":"Chunwei Liu","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome!\r\nI am a second year PhD student in Department of Computer Science at University of Chicago\r\n\r\nBefore coming to Uchicago, I earned my MS degree in Computer Science from Iowa State University and PhD degree in Statistics from Stanford University. My advisers were [Karin Dorman](http://www.gdcb.iastate.edu/faculty_and_research/bios/kdorman.shtml) (MS thesis) and the magical [Persi Diaconis](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/) (PhD thesis). I did my post-doc work with Professor [Kenneth Lange](http://research.mednet.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702) at UCLA and have maintained an active collaboration with him ever since.\r\n\r\nFor research manuscripts, please check the ['Publication'](https://github.ncsu.edu/hzhou3/hzhou3.github.io/publication.md) page.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
